Premier League 2023/2024 Web Scraping and Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves scraping data from an English football website to gather information about Premier League matches for the 2023/2024 season. The collected data is then analyzed and used to build a predictive model.

Files Included
Football.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the web scraping, data cleaning, engineering, and machine learning model steps.
matchs.csv: CSV file containing the scraped match data from the Premier League website.
best_random_forest_model.pkl: Serialized Random Forest model saved after hyperparameter tuning.
Project Steps
Web Scraping:

Utilized BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to scrape match data from the Premier League website.
Data collected includes details about match dates, teams, scores, and other relevant metrics.
Data Cleaning and Engineering:

The scraped data was cleaned to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Feature engineering was performed to prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand the data distribution and relationships.
Key insights were derived from the data to guide feature selection and model building.
Machine Learning Model:

A Random Forest model was trained to predict match outcomes.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Feature importance was analyzed to select the most significant features.
